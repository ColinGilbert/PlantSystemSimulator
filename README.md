I did not consider this part of the central project itself, but uploaded it in case you wanted to play with it.

It accepts and pushes state perfectly well, and I'm confident that it will not crash in front of a class full of people.

However, the code for the simulation loop hasn't been tweaked much and leads to silly values, but these values rest within acceptable physical measures.

You could argue that it is a feature; we don't want our system backend filtering out any of the odd data from a broken sensor or damaged machine. It is good that it can be shown on the web UI that the values get sent faithfully.
